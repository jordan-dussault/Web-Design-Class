            <h5>About the Author</h5>
            <p> Suzanne Collins was born in 1962 in Hartford, Connecticut. She started her career writing for several Nickelodeon shows along with publishing multiple children's books. Collins has always had a strong interest in Greek mythology, a genre that tends to influence most of her books. This influence mixed with the stories she would hear from her father, who was a U.S. Air Force Officer and a Vietnam War veteran, inspired her most sucessful book <i>The Hunger Games</i>.</p>

                <p><i>The Hunger Games</i> was released in 2008, and it was a massive success that became a New York Times Bestseller. The sequels <i>Catching Fire</i> and <i>Mockingjay</i> were also huge successes. These books reignited the excitement for the dystopian genre, but they also tackled a lot of very real and dark problems within American society. Even though <i>The Hunger Games</i> was a teen dystopian book with a love triangle, it made people think about some of the scariest problems about our world and what it could potentially look like in a hundred years. </p>

                <p><i>The Hunger Games</i> book was already a smashing success by itself. However, it REALLY took over pop culture when it was brought to the big screen in 2012. The movie grossed over 400 million dollars at the box office, which only made the book one hundred time more popular than it already was. Every girl wanted to be Katniss Everdeen for Halloween. The sport of archery exponentially grew in popularity. This franchise was literally inescapable for three years. </p>

                <p>I love the Hunger Games for so many reasons. First of all, I think it genuinely is a great book that is super easy to read. I read this book for the first time in middle school, and I completely acknowledge that this book is definitely at a middle school reading level. I also am very aware that I hold a lot of personal nostalgia with this book, and that is absolutely why it's my favorite, but I think that's ok. Even if it isn't the most advanced literature in the world, I go back to this book at least once a year because I still find it interesting. The characters are relatable and likable (most of the time), he story is compelling and captivating, and overall, this book is just a good time. Also, I think its social commentary continues to age incredibly well. </p>
