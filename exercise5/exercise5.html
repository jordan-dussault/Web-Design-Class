        <h3>Class Reflection</h3>

        <p>Overall, I genuienly loved this class! I learned so much about coding and web design, and I'm really happy with the work I was able to produce! It can all definitely be improved in the future with more practice, but the work I was able to accomplish this semester is a really great start! A specific part of this class that I found interesting was working with the web as a designer. The web is different than any other canvas in the world because it's infinite, and learning how to edit and not over-design websites was a really fascinating part of this class. I hope I get to keep using my web design skills after this class! Coding can take be tedious and time-consuming sometimes, but it also allows you to create really cool art. At the beginning of the class we talked about how coding gives you power and freedom, and I definitely agree. I was always on of those people who was always interested in art but I never made any myself because I didn't have a natural talent for drawing or painting, which is why I'm so drawn to designing things in technicalogical spaces because I can finally have the art that I want to make come out the way I envision it in my head. I'm super excited to have learned the fundamentals of javascript as well! I've taken some really abysmal computer science classes at Fordham, so I'm really happy that this one was so good and fun! </p>
