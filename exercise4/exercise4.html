    <h1>The Web's Grain Reflection</h1>

    <p>
        This article of reframing the way that Frank Chimero views technology was honestly way more relatable and interesting than I thought it was going to be. His outlook on reimagining technology to avoid inevitable disappointment definitely caught me off guard at first, but the more I thought about it, he is absolutely right. The initial excitement of any new technology eventually wears off, so finding new ways to interact with it, and appreciate it is important. I think this directly relates to my relationship with web design because while learning to change background colors and font sizes on a website is really cool, if I only stuck to just doing that, I would get bored of web design really fast. However, I want to keep learning new things about web design (and coding in general) and expanding my "toolbox" so that I can keep creating things that excite me.<br><br>

Something that stood out to me in this reading was when Chimero compared Apple's website to a bear that can ride a bicycle. I thought that was hilarious because I never thought of it that way but he'so right. Lots of websites, including Apple look so fancy and intricate at first glance, but then you actually start using them and your computer (at least my computer) sounds like a rocketship trying to take off. This really changed my perspective on creating websites because there's so many times where I see a website that someone else made that is similar to Apple's in the sense that I look at it and say "Woah I can't do that" but the point of web design isn't to make the coolest looking thing that doesn't work that well. It's to create a design that best complements what you are trying to convey to your audience. <br><br>

So for this website, it might seemingly look cool to have the background color be tie-dye when the browser is between 1000 and 1200 pixels. However, when a user actually does that, they will see that it is very distracting, and takes away from the words on the page, which is not what I want. Singular and lighter background colors work much better with this particular design because they make allow the black text to pop and be more easily readable. <br><br>

Something else Chimero talked about in the article was the idea of edgelessness that I thought was cool. He talked about traditional art having uniform edges that artists work within, where the Internet has edgeless surfaces that the artists can change and control. I really liked the idea of learning how to collaborate in spaces that things are connected. This made me reimagine how I view web design from an artistic perspective because when an artist is painting on a canvas, they have to contain their art within the borders of that canvas. However, when an artist is designing a website, they can create whatever art they want within an infinite canvas and then establish the borders of it afterwards, which is actually kind of crazy. <br><br>
