        <p><i>Lover</i> followed <i>Reputation</i> by leaving behind the toxicity and drama that came with that era to solely focus on the love that <i>Reputation</i> ended with. Described by Swift as a "lover letter to love", the album explores wide-ranging emotions like infatuation, commitment, lust, and heartache; a few songs discuss political issues such as LGBT rights and feminism. Lover's cover art and visual aesthetic feature bright pastel colors. <i>Lover's</i> bright and bubbly aesthetic was a stark juxtaposition to <i>Reputation's</i> dark and edgy aesthetic.In the US, Lover was Swift's sixth consecutive Billboard 200 number-one album and the best-selling album of 2019.</p>

        <h9> This era of Swift's life centered around moving on from any and all drama that had ever plagued her career and focusing on things in her life that made her happy. Swift released a documentary detailing the personal nuances of her career up until 2019 called "Mrs Americana." This documentary along with the openess and vulnerability on the <i>Lover</i> album reminded people of Swift's inviting relatability and why they fell in love with her in the first place back when she was only a teenager. </h9>
