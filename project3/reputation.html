            <h9> To explain how <i>Reputation</i> came to be would take ridiculously long. If you want to know the full backstory about the controversy that inspired this album, you can read more about it <a href="https://people.com/music/kanye-west-famous-inside-his-and-taylor-swifts-relationship-history/#:~:text=It%20all%20started%20when%20the,I%20made%20that%20bitch%20famous.%22"> <span class="here"> here.</span></a> Essentially, Taylor Swift got cancelled in 2016 after being accused of lying and manipulating Kanye West. <i>Reputation</i> was an album that sought to clear Swift's name and tell her side of the story. This album also details the beginning of what would be a six year relationship with her boyfriend. Swift said that Reputation consists of a linear timeline: it begins with how she felt when she started working on the album and transitions to how she felt by the time she completed it. She split the album into two sides; one contains songs about vengeance and drama, and the other about finding love and friendship. </h9>

        <p> While <i>Reputation</i> did its job of re-establishing Taylor Swift's good reputation to the media and general public, it did not comercially perform as well as her other albums. Reputation is primarily an electropop album. It incorporates a heavy, maximalist electronic production with EDM instrumentation and rhythms. Today, <i>Reputation</i> probably Swift's most polarizing album, with most critics not being too fond of it, while many of her fans believe that it is her best album to date.</p>
