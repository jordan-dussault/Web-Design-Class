        <h9> <i>Speak Now</i> was released in 2010. While Speak Now didn't see the same insane commerical success as <i>Fearless</i>, it was still successful and to this day is one of her fans' most beloved albums. One of the biggest accomplishments of <i>Speak Now</i> was that Swift wrote all of the songs on the album without any co-writers. The title of the album represents a common theme throughout the album, which is speaking up about things that Swift wished she had said in the moment, but didn't.</h9>

        <p> <i>Speak Now</i> was released after the first big controversy of Taylor Swift's career. While giving her acceptance speech for "Best Female Video" at the 2009 Video Music Awards, Kanye West went up on stage and stole the microphone from her to express that he felt Beyonce should have won the award instead. This was the first time Swift had ever received any serious backlash in her career from the general public or the media. Swift had also been receiving harsh criticism about her vocal abilities during this time as well. These events along with the typical confusion that comes along with being 19-years-old inspired the lyrics on the album. The themes on this album are much more mature than her other work, while still being presented from the perspective of someone who has a young understanding of the world. </p>
