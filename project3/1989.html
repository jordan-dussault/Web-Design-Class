        <p> <i>1989</i> was released in 2014 and marked Taylor Swift's complete transition into pop music. She titled 1989 after her birth year as a symbolic artistic rebirth. The album was also heavily inspired by 80s synth-pop. In March 2014, Swift moved from Nashville to New York City; she recounted that moving geographically while being unattached romantically prompted her to embrace new creative ideas. Similar to <i>Fearless</i>,<i>1989</i> amassed tons of commercial success and awards, with its singles being some of the top performing songs of Swift's discography. <i>1989</i> also earned Swift her second Album of the Year award at the 58th Grammy Awards.</p>
