    <div class="content">

        <div class="first"> <p>Something Ursula K. Le Guin said in the "Rant About Technology" reading that I thought was really interesting is the idea that "technology is how society copes with physical reality." I think this idea only continues to be more and more true as society develops over time. Almost every aspect of my life requires some kind of technology. I don't think that's necessarily a bad thing though. I think when people today hear the word "technology," they immediately think of things like iPhones and the Internet. However, as K. Le Guin argues, technology is everything from wheels to sidewalks to doors. The dangers of digital technology are very real and can have very serious repercusssions, but that in no way means that all technology ever invented is bad for society. I actually think the exact opposite is true. </p></div>

        <div class="second"><p>I liked the idea Laurel Schwulst brought up in her article that "we need individuals rather than corporations to guide the web's future." The internet has become overwhelmingly monetized at the hands of Google and Facebook over the past decade, and the vast majority of websites are more concerned with the ads you are seeing on the sides than the actual content being put on the site. The power that big corporations have on today's internet is astounding. So, I definitely agree with Schwulst that having more individual ideas, perspectives, designs, etc. on the internet would be sucha  breath of fresh air from all of the processed, corporate advertising garbage that is constantly spewed out at web users. Individuals have so many fresh and creative ideas, perspectives, and experiences to offer the Internet, and I think paying more attention to those individuals will drastically improve a lot of people's experince on the Internet.</p></div>

        <div class="third"><p>I agree with the points J.R. Carpenter made in the "A Handmade Web" article about the value of handmade things. I don't think I had ever thought about coding or websites as things that are handmade, so this article was super interesting to me. Throughout my life, I've always enjoyed making and building things but I usually find that they never come out quite the way I want them to. I definitely wouldn't consider myself a crafty person. I think this is why I might be drawn to coding and web design because it still feels like I'm building something, and the computer makes it come out exactly the way I want it. Every professor that has ever taught me coding has said that coding gives you freedom, and I agree. The more types of code you know, the more tools you have to be able to build and create different things for the world. </p></div>
