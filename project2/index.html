        <h1>Target Website Critique</h1>

            <h6>Target.com is an e-commerce website for the American retail corporation, Target. It's main purpose is to advertise and sell their large variety of products including clothing, shoes, technology, food, home decor, etc.</h6>
    

            <h2>Content</h2>

            <section class="flex-area">
                <div class="column">
                    <p>I think the content on Target's website is organized in a way that makes a lot of sense, which is especially important for Target because they sell so many different things. One of the options in the top menu is all of the different categories of products, and these categories are also displayed at the bottom of the homepage too. This is helpful for both new and returning customers to find the things that they are looking for more efficiently. Additionally, if you sign into a Target account that you make, the website will show you products that it thinks you will like based on your previous Target purchases. I think this website does a great job of displaying its content with a layout that is clear, pictures and videos that are engaging, and an overall easy experience that encourages their customers to buy their products.</p>

            <h2>Visual Appeal/UI</h2>
            <p>Something I really liked this website's visual appeal was how colorful it was. This website uses lots of colors but it uses them in a way that makes sense and is nice to look at. For example, they use green for their gardening section and blue for their swimwear section. Sections are very important for Target's website, and it does a good job of making each of its sections look visually appealing to customers. I also think the use of red throughout the website is very smart because the brand color is bright red, but it is used sparingly so that whenever it shows up, it really pops and draws attention to whatever it wants the consumer to see the most. The font throughout the website is consistent and easy to read. All of the pictures and videos are high quality, and correlate to the products they are next to. There is definitely a visual hierarchy based on what Target wants to push the most. For example, the homepage has all of the newest and trendiest deals. These are products that Target wants to push the most, so they display them in big colorful letters and blocks at the forefront of the website. I've also used the website on my phone a lot, and it still looks pretty good! I think most e-commerce websites look better and less crammed on a desktop, but I think Target's website did a pretty good job of adapting to mobile devices.

            <h2>Interactivity/UX</h2>

            <section class="flex-area">
                <div class="column1">
                    <img src="images/targettanktopfront.png">
                    
                </div>
                <div class="column">
                    <p>The interactivity for the Target website is helpful and intuitive. The way the website is set up makes a lot of sense. Everything is seperated into categories to make finding products easy. The search bar is also right at the top of the page which is essential for this website (with the ability to speak instead of type your search). There are banners and and colors that help direct customers on where to click for certain things. One specific thing I noticed about the User Interface of Target's website is when you hover over certain products, it will show you different angles of them without the user actually having to click on it. (I tried to recreate this effect on the left). There are multiple images of every product along with a rating (out of 5 stars) underneath the price. The website also keeps track of things that you have recently viewed in case you want to back to them later. The target website is definitely an enjoyable and easy experience. You can tell that a lot of thought was put into the user experience both aesthetically and practically. The interactivity and navigation is all very straightforward and simple. This is a website that needed to made as simple as possible, and I think it succeeds because of that.</p>

            <h2>Recommendations</h2>
            <p> Honestly, I don't think there is a lot about Target's website that needs to be improved. I think the website is very visually appealing and straightforward. One recommendation I would have to improve this website would be to maybe make the "Add to Cart" button slightly bigger. I like that it is the only red thing on the page, but I think the button itself could be a little bigger, just to better match the ratio to everything else on the page. (It might actually be fine I'm just kind of nitpicking). I think Target made a really great website that matches their aesthetic as a company, and incentivizes their customers to buy their products.
